                                <p align="justify"> In the clinical use of thermal tissue fusion, which uses heat and pressure to fuse arterial tissues, the input parameters of applied pressure, fusion temperature, and duration of energy input have largely been optimized through trial and error. The objective of this work is to experimentally elucidate the effect applied pressure has on bond strength and internal tissue temperature during fusion. The outcomes will aid in further characterization of the bond between thermally fused tissues which may direct the design of future thermal fusion devices.</p>
                                <p align="justify">The role of applied pressure was investigated by fusing porcine splenic arteries at applied loads ranging from 10-500 N. Pressure was applied to the arteries using a standard uniaxial tensile testing system to maintained a prescribed force (MTS Insight II). To achieve fusion, an input heat of 170° C was applied for 3.0 s via aluminum nitride heaters which were mounted to the MTS using custom fixtures. Fusion strength was then evaluated using burst pressure testing, which measures the intraluminal pressure at which a thermal bond fails. Intraluminal temperature was measured in a separate procedure with an array of five thermocouples inserted into the artery lumen during fusion [1]. Finally, samples of fused arteries from each applied load were histologically assessed following Hematoxylin & Eosin staining.</p>
                                <p align="justify">The fused vessels exhibited a peak in burst pressure for an applied load of 35 N before falling to a near constant value at higher loads (Figure 1). The intraluminal temperature measurements largely increased with increasing applied pressure. Based on the histological images, the peak in fusion strength corresponds to fusions between the media layers of the vessel, while the fall and plateau occurs when the media ruptures out of the fusion region and bonds form between the adventitia layers. These results indicate that an applied load of approximately 35 N is optimal for thermal fusion, a previously undetermined value as most commercial fusion devices apply loads around 100 N. The results also suggest that media fusions are stronger than adventitia fusions; the particular compounds or ratio of compounds that allow media to form stronger fusions merits further investigation. </p>

								<p align="justify">The Six Sigma workshop provided by Dr. Littlejohn is geared for early career professionals, graduate students, and junior/senior undergraduates.  The workshop will provide an introduction to six sigma, it's benefits in design, manufacturing, and business, give real-world examples for the attendees to work through, and discuss options for further learning and certification.</p>
                                <p align="justify">Dr. Littlejohn received his Ph.D. in Applied Statistics from the University of Oklahoma in 1977. Subsequently he began a teaching career at North Central College and began consulting with The R Group, LTD in the areas of Market Research and Forecasting. After approximately 5 years of teaching and consulting Dr. Littlejohn joined Sealed Power Corporation as a statistician where he introduced the use of SPC and Experimental Design. He was subsequently promoted to Quality Assurance Manager for Sealed Power Division of Sealed Power Corporation.</p>
                                <p align="justify">In 1982 Dr. Littlejohn joined Luftig & Warren International, Inc. a consulting firm that specialized in providing consulting services and training in all areas of the Quality Sciences throughout North and South America, Asia, and Europe. His work as a senior consultant with LWI involved the entire breadth of topics in the areas of business and quality improvement, including product and process improvement through the application of sophisticated problem solving techniques and advanced statistical and research methods. He also provided training to the firm’s many clients in all aspects of the application of statistics, and business and industrial research methodologies through 1998.</p>
								<p align="justify">After leaving LWI, Dr. Littlejohn’s consulting activities included training and consulting activities in experimental design and industrial research, customer survey analysis, business system development and improvement, business, manufacturing and administrative product and process improvement, process control, and statistical start-ups. Dr. Littlejohn provided these services to businesses engaged in metal processing, food and beverage, electronics / high tech manufacturing and assembly, ink and chemical, automotive and truck suppliers, mining, HMO service and miscellaneous other industries.</p>

								<p align="justify">Ben joined EWH in November 2011 after working in Tanzania as an on the ground coordinator for the Summer Institute. He is an alumni of the 2009 Tanzania Summer Institute and held leadership roles in Engineers With Out Borders at Clemson University, where he received his BS in BioEngineering in 2009. His senior design project was a low cost disposable scalpel for the developing world. He has worked with students in Vietnam, Mexico and Clemson teaching seminars, labs and leading research projects. In his spare time Ben enjoys spending time outdoors and technical projects such as building bikes and modifying cars. His unique combination of student leadership experience and technical skills makes him the ideal choice to manage and expand our Summer Institute programs. </p>
