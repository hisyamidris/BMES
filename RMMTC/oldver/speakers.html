                    <h5>The speech title is: "Identity and Career Progression: Differential Experiences for Minorities and Women".</h5>

                    <blockquote><p>Racial and ethnic minorities and women differentially experience the academy in a manner that impacts career progression and outcomes. Identify formation provides a framework for examining these differences and gaining a better understanding of factors that contribute to them. Drawing upon lived experiences and extant literature, this presentation explores positioning in terms of race and gender in the academy and its relationship to career progression using identity as a lens. Potential strategies that can be employed to enhance the career progression of all groups will be addressed.</p></blockquote>

                        <h5>An overview is:</h5>

                        <p>Dr. Chwang's talk aims to illustrate the ethics and critical thinking that are important in medical technologies. To illustrate, he will present the following example:</p>

                            <blockquote><p>In the 1990s, a pharmaceutical company chose to test its new HIV drug in an impoverished region of Africa--where the standard of care for HIV is nothing--so as to be able to test against placebo, which would not have been allowed in the US.  This talk will examine whether this is wrongful exploitation, or rather an unproblematic, mutually-beneficial exchange.  </p></blockquote>
